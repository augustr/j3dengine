## Overview

This projects aims to port/rewrite from scratch an old C++ Direct3D9 Game engine of mine, using Java and OpenGL with GLSL shaders. I choose java becauase I may want to port it to android some day, and OpenGL for learning purposes. Since there aren't too many modern JOGL code examples available online this might also serve as an example implementation that might be helpful for some people wanting to learn more.

## Installation

Just build an run. Should load a height map with multilayer textures, lighting and shading out of the box.
