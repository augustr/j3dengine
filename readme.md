# J3DEngine

## Overview

This projects aims to port/rewrite an old C++ Direct3D9 Game engine of mine, using Java and OpenGL with GLSL shaders. I choose java becauase I may want to port it to android some day, and OpenGL for learning purposes.

## Installation

Just build an run. Should load a height map with multilayer textures, lighting and shading out of the box.
